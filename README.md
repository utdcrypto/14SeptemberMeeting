For developing outside the sandboxed environment Remix provides, the development tools you'd likely want are:

A compatible version of NodeJS (we HIGHLY recommend using the Node Version Manager utility: https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
The Solidity docs: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/index.html
The Solidity compiler: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/installing-solidity.html?highlight=compiler
An Ethereum client (Parity is both lighter and faster, but it's recommended that developers use Geth to ensure compliance with the reference implementation);
Ganache or GanacheCli (command line version);
Truffle (mainly for running tests: https://www.truffleframework.com/)
